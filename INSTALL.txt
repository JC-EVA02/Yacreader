COMPILATION GUIDE FOR LINUX/UNIX USERS
**********************************
YACReader and YACReaderLibrary are build using qmake. To build and install the program, run:

qmake
make
make install

from the source dir. For seperate builds of YACReader or YACReaderLibrary, enter their respective subfolders and run the commands from there.

Build options:
---------------------
You can adjust the installation prefix as well als the path make install uses to install the files.
Use "qmake PREFIX=DIR" to configure YACReader for your systems default prefix (for example "/", "/usr", "/usr/local").

For packaging purposes, you can use "make install INSTALL_ROOT=DIR" to install to a different location than the prefix.

Default values:

PREFIX=/usr
INSTALL_ROOT=""

On embedded devices that don't support desktop OpenGL, it is recommended to use the no_opengl config option:

qmake CONFIG+=no_opengl

This will remove any dependency on desktop OpenGL.
