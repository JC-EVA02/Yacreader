COMPILATION GUIDE FOR LINUX/UNIX USERS
**********************************
YACReader and YACReaderLibrary are build using qmake. To build and install the program, run:

qmake-qt5 CONFIG+=[Options]
make
make install

from the source dir. For seperate builds of YACReader or YACReaderLibrary, enter their respective subfolders and run the commands from there.

For the headless version of YACReaderLibrary enter the YACReaderLibrary folder and run:

qmake-qt5 YACReaderLibraryServer.pro

This will select the build config for the headless version instead of the gui version. You can then continue the build as described above.


Dependencies:
-----------------------

- Qt >= 5.3 with the following modules:
	- declarative
	- quickcontrols
	- sql
	- script
	- multimedia
	- imageformats
	- opengl
	- sql-sqlite
	- network
	
- poppler-qt5
- qrencode
- sqllite
- glu
- a decompression backend, either 7zip or unarr (see below)

Please note that not all of these dependencies are needed at build time. A good example for this is YACReaderLibrary's GridView mode which will
silently fail and only show a white page if the proper qml modules (declarative, quickcontrols) are not installed.


Decompression backend:
--------------------------------------

YACReader supports two decompression backends:

- unarr
- p7zip=9.20.1

These can be selected at build time by adding either CONFIG+=unarr or CONFIG+=7zip as an option when running qmake. 
If none of these is provided, the build system will default to unarr on Linux/Unix and [p]7zip on Windows and OS X.

The decompression backends have their own dependencies and require additional steps like downloading additional source code
for setup. Please consult the README files provided in the compressed_archive and compressed_archive/unarr folders for details.

If you chose to build YACReader with p7zip as a backend on Linux/Unix, please take notice that this backend has some problems:

- p7zip > 9.20.1 is not supported
- p7zip 9.20.1 has known bugs that are fixed only in the later versions
- a system update that replaces p7zip 9.20.1 with a later version will make YACReader unusable

If your system already ships with p7zip > 9.20.1 you can place 7z.so and the Codecs folder with the Rar29.so from p7zip 9.20.1 in /usr/lib/yacreader 
YACReader will check this folder first and can thus continue using 7zip as a backend with p7zip > 9.20.1 installed on your system.


Other build options:
------------------------------

You can adjust the installation prefix as well als the path make install uses to install the files.
Use "qmake PREFIX=DIR" to configure YACReader for your systems default prefix (for example "/", "/usr", "/usr/local").

For packaging purposes, you can use "make install INSTALL_ROOT=DIR" to install to a different location than the prefix.

Default values:

PREFIX=/usr
INSTALL_ROOT=""

On embedded devices that don't support desktop OpenGL, it is recommended to use the no_opengl config option:

qmake-qt5 CONFIG+=no_opengl

This will remove any dependency on desktop OpenGL and hardlock YACReader's coverflow to software rendering. Please note that it 
doesn't actually remove OpenGL from the build, the Qt toolkit will still make use of it.

Pdf support can be disabled by using the no_pdf option:

qmake-qt5 CONFIG+=no_pdf

This also removes the need for the poppler-qt5 library to be installed.

******************************
If you're compiling YACReader because there is no package available for your Linux distribution please consider creating and submitting a package.
While we do provide packages for .deb based distributions aus well as an AUR package for Archlinux we are in need of packagers especially for RPM based
distributions. If you are interested, please contact selmf on the YACReader forums or write an email to info@yacreader.com
