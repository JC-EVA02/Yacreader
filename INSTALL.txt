COMPILATION GUIDE FOR LINUX/UNIX USERS
**********************************
YACReader and YACReaderLibrary are build using qmake. To build and install the program, run:

qmake-qt5 CONFIG+=[Options]
make
make install

from the source dir. For seperate builds of YACReader or YACReaderLibrary, enter their respective subfolders and run the commands from there.

Dependencies:
-----------------------

- Qt >= 5.3 with the following modules:
	- declarative
	- sql
	- script
	- multimedia
	- imageformats
	- opengl
	- sql-sqlite
	
- poppler-qt5
- qrencode
- sqllite
- glu
- a decompression backend, either 7zip or unarr (see below)


Decompression backend:
---------------------------------------

YACReader supports two decompression backends:

- unarr
- p7zip=9.20.1

These can be selected at build time by adding either CONFIG+=unarr or CONFIG+=7zip as an option when running qmake. 
If none of these is provided, the build system will default to unarr on Linux/Unix and [p]7zip on Windows and OS X.

The decompression backends have their own dependencies and require additional steps like downloading additional source code
for setup. Please consult the README files provided in the compressed_archive and compressed_archive/unarr folders for details.

If you chose to build YACReader with p7zip as a backend on Linux/Unix, please take notice that this backend has some problems:

- p7zip > 9.20.1 is not supported
- p7zip 9.20.1 has known bugs that are fixed only in the later versions
- a system update that replaces p7zip 9.20.1 with a later version will make YACReader unusable

If your system already ships with p7zip > 9.20.1 you can place 7z.so and the Codecs folder with the Rar29.so from p7zip 9.20.1 in /usr/lib/yacreader 
YACReader will check this folder first and can thus continue using 7zip as a backend with p7zip > 9.20.1 installed on your system.

Other build options:
---------------------

You can adjust the installation prefix as well als the path make install uses to install the files.
Use "qmake PREFIX=DIR" to configure YACReader for your systems default prefix (for example "/", "/usr", "/usr/local").

For packaging purposes, you can use "make install INSTALL_ROOT=DIR" to install to a different location than the prefix.

Default values:

PREFIX=/usr
INSTALL_ROOT=""

On embedded devices that don't support desktop OpenGL, it is recommended to use the no_opengl config option:

qmake CONFIG+=no_opengl

This will remove any dependency on desktop OpenGL and hardlock rendering to software.
